# DriveScraper
DriveScraper is a tool that allows you to scrape data from a newly added hard drive in the background.</br>
How it works: When you run the script, it keeps on scanning your computers ports in a loop of 1/2 seconds for newly added drives. When a new drive is detected it immediately copies data from it and pastes it where you've chosen in the instructions.

On Windows:
Open cmd and cd to where the script is located, type "py drivescraper.py".
